üß™ Testing the API
You can test the API using:
Postman Collection
Import the following into Postman:

Base URL: http://localhost:3000/api
Set up environment variables for token and base_url

üîÑ Design Decisions & Assumptions
Database Design:

PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance and robust relationship management
Composite unique constraint on (book_id, user_id) ensures one review per user per book
Soft delete approach could be implemented but hard delete used for simplicity
Created_by field in books table allows tracking who added each book

Authentication:

JWT tokens for stateless authentication
7-day expiration for tokens (configurable)
bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds for password hashing
Email-based authentication (could extend to username)

API Design:

RESTful principles followed throughout
Consistent response format with proper HTTP status codes
Pagination implemented for all list endpoints
Case-insensitive search for better user experience

Validation:

Server-side validation using Joi for all inputs
Database constraints as additional safety layer
Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

Performance:

Database indexes on frequently queried columns
Pagination to limit response sizes
Rate limiting to prevent abuse
Connection pooling for database efficiency

üöÄ Deployment Notes
Environment Variables for Production:
envNODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
JWT_SECRET=very-long-random-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
Production Considerations:

Use environment-specific database
Set up proper logging (Winston, Morgan)
Implement monitoring and health checks
Use HTTPS in production
Consider using Redis for session storage
Set up database backups
Configure proper CORS for production domains



JWT Token Invalid:

Check JWT_SECRET in .env file
Verify token format: "Bearer <token>"
Ensure token hasn't expired


Validation Errors:

Check request body format
Verify all required fields are provided
Ensure data types match schema requirements


Port Already in Use:

Change PORT in .env file
Kill existing processes using the port
